<h1>Administrator skin</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Administrator skin is the most comprehensive skin that TimeTracker3 
offers as its user interface. Its primary goal is to simplify the workspace 
administration tasks; however, it can also be used effectively for normal 
day-to-day operation. This is the skin the users see when they first start 
TimeTracker3.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Administrator skin" height="587" src="../../../images/en_GB/Skins/AdminSkin.png" width="677" /></p>
<p>Individual controls offered by the Administrator skin are:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Menu bar</strong> - located at the top of the TimeTracker3 
	window, it provides all administrative and day-to-day commands that 
	TimeTracker3 offers to the users. Presently, the set of these commands is 
	fixed, as are keyboard shortcuts assigned for quick invocation of the more 
	frequently used commands.</li>
	<li><strong>Toolbar</strong> - is located just under the menu bar and 
	presents a graphical view of the more frequently used TimeTracker3 commands 
	for quick invocation with a single mouse click (on all screens) or a single 
	touch (for systems with touch screen).</li>
	<li><strong>Current activity indicator</strong> - located right under the 
	toolbar, this field indicated which Activity or Task is currently being 
	recorded and for how long. If the recording is underway, the special Stop 
	button allows stopping it, recording the corresponding Work item. NOTE that 
	the Work item will also be recorded if a recording of a new Activity or Task 
	starts while the previous recording is still underway.</li>
	<li><strong>View selector</strong> - is a tabbed area which presents all 
	Views that TimeTracker3 offers to the user, with each view occupying its own 
	tab. To switch to a particular View simply click (or tap) the corresponding 
	tab; keyboard shortcuts 0..9 also act to the same effect. Note that all 
	TimeTracker3 views strive to offer the same keyboard shortcuts to perform 
	the same actions (e.g. pressing the 1 key opens the Users view, etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>View area</strong> - occupies the larger part of the 
	TimeTracker3' window. Depending on what Voiew is currently active, it will 
	offer the corresponding view of the current workspace and allow the user to 
	carry out various view-specific activities there.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can maximize or minimize the TimeTracker3 window as you see fit, or to 
change its position as desired. TimeTracker3 will remember the main window's 
location and state (e.g. maximized) and, if the user decides to quit or re-start 
TimeTracker3, the window position and state (maximized?) will be restored. <em>
The one important exception</em> is a Wayland (i.e. <em>not</em> X11) session on 
Linux - the Wayland window compositor takes special (and questionable) pride in 
completely ignoring the user's choice of where the application windows are 
placed on the desktop.</p>
