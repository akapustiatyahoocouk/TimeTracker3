<h1>Slim skin</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Slim skin is the TimeTracker3's preferred skin for everyday work, where 
administrative tasks (such as being assigned to work on a new Task or completing 
a Task) are rare as compared to switching between everyday tasks and activities 
most frequently used. Its primary goal is to minimize the screen estate required 
for TimeTracker3 to operate; however, it still provides full administrative 
capabilities on those rare occasions when such are needed.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Administrator skin" src="../../../images/en_GB/Skins/SlimSkin.png" /></p>
<p>The Slim skin's UI consists solely of the current user's Quick Picks list, 
with each frequently used Activity or Task represented by a single button. 
Clicking (or tapping) on one of these buttons starts recording the corresponding 
Task Or Activity, repeated clicking (or tapping) on the same button stops the 
recording and records the corresponding Work item.</p>
<p>As special cases:</p>
<ul>
	<li>If a Task or Activity is already being recorded, clicking (or tapping) 
	on a button representing a different Task or Activity stops the previous 
	recording, records the corresponding Work item and starts recording the 
	newly clicked (or tapped) Task or Activity.</li>
	<li>If&nbsp; Task or Activity is being recorded, clicking (or tapping) on 
	the "Stop current activity" button stops the recording and records the 
	corresponding Work unit.</li>
	<li>Pressing the left mouse button anywhere in the Slim skin's window and 
	dragging the mouse around will move the window; releasing the mouse button 
	will finalize the new position of the Slim skin's window. For touch screens 
	the sequence of actions is press-drag-release.</li>
	<li>To resize the Slim skin's window use the standard window resizing 
	techniques; this normally involves dragging the window's borders.</li>
	<li>The Slim skin's window will try to remember its position and size 
	between runs. <em>
The one important exception</em> is a Wayland (i.e. <em>not</em> X11) session on 
Linux - the Wayland window compositor takes special (and questionable) pride in 
completely ignoring the user's choice of where the application windows are 
placed on the desktop.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Keyboard shortcuts</h2>
<p>The Slim skin uses the same keyboard shortcuts as all other Skins (such as 
Administrator skin). For example, pressing "1" brings up the Users view, 
pressing Ctrl+P brings up the Preferences dialog, etc. These shortcuts are also 
listed alongside the commands they invoke in the Slim skin's context menu (see 
below).</p>
<p>Note that Slim skin will open various views in modal dialogs, which need to 
be closed before the normal work can resume.</p>
<h2>The context menu</h2>
<p>Right-clicking anywhere within the Slim skin's window pops up a context menu, 
which contains the full complement of work-related and administrative actions 
provided by TimeTracker3. The availability of each action is, of course, 
subjects to the Capabilities granted by the currently logged in user and whether 
or not the currently open workspace is read-only or not.</p>
<h2>The system tray</h2>
<p>As a special feature, the Slim skin's window can be minimized to the system 
tray if the underlying OS supports the system tray. This is achieved via the 
context menu (described in the previous section).</p>
<p>When the TimeTracker3 has been minimized to the system tray:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Double-clicking the corresponding system tray icon restores the Slim 
	skin window to its previous position and size.</li>
	<li>Right-clicking the corresponding system tray icon pops up the same 
	context menu as would be visible in the "windowed" mode; the only difference 
	is in "minimize to system tray" command, available in "windowed" mode, is 
	replaced by "restore" command that leads back to the "windowed" mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>IMPORTANT: The Slim skin is essentially a colorful representation of the 
Quick Picks list for the current user. If the Quick Picks list is modified (by 
invoking the corresponding context menu command, or by using the "P" keyboard 
shortcut), the available Task/Activity buttons are rearranged to reflect the 
changes made to the Quick Picks list, but the Slim skin window itself is not 
e.g. resized. Therefore, after adding items to the Quick Picks list (or removing 
items from it) the manual resize of the Slim skin window may be in order so as 
to keep all items visible and not <em>too</em> large.</p>
