<h1>Works and Events</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>TimeTracker3 uses Works and Events to record the daily log of what each 
	team member was working on. This allows both managing one's daily effort on 
	a day-by-day basis and integrating this daily logs into aggregated 
	activity/effort reports.</p>

<h1>Works</h1>
<p>A Work (also called a Work Unit) is a record of the fact that a specific 
period of time was dedicated to working on a specific Activity or Task. For such 
a Work Unit, the following information is recorded:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Its <strong>start</strong> and <strong>end</strong> times.</li>
	<li>Its associated <strong>Account</strong> (who did the work?)</li>
	<li>Its associated <strong>Activity or Task</strong> (what was the time 
	spent on?)</li>
</ul>
<p>TimeTracker3 will normally not allow removing recorded Work Units from the 
historical data. Of course, someone acting as a "workspace administrator" may do 
anything they need within the managed workspace, including the removal or old or 
irrelevant Work Units but even then the practice is strongly discouraged.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>An Event is a record that, at some moment in the past, something relevant to 
the daily work has happened. There are several kinds of Events that TimeTracker3 
recognises and records:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Activity (or Task) start/end events - TimeTracker3 allows configuring 
	specific Activities (and Tasks) to actively require the user to enter a 
	comment when starting or stopping that specific Activity or Task (or both 
	when starting and stopping the one).</li>
	<li>Task completion comments - TimeTracker3 allows configuring Tasks so as 
	to actively require the user to enter a comment when marking that Task as 
	"completed".</li>
	<li>Arbitrary comments - TimeTracker allows the user to enter an arbitrary 
	comment at any time during the working day, even if that user is currently 
	working on some Activity or Task. These comments allow for better historical 
	perspective on what happened during a given day.</li>
</ul>
<p>For every Event, the following information is recorded:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Its <strong>occurrence</strong> time.</li>
	<li>Its associated <strong>Account</strong> (who logged the comment?)</li>
	<li>Its associated <strong>Activities or Tasks</strong> (which of these the 
	comment is related to?)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similarly to recorded Work Units, TimeTracker3 will normally not allow 
removing recorded Events from the historical data. Again, someone acting as a 
"workspace administrator" may do anything they need within the managed 
workspace, including removal of old or irrelevant Events, but even then the 
practice is strongly discouraged.</p>
