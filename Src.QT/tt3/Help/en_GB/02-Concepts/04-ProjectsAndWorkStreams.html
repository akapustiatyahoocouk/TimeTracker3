<h1>Projects and Work Streams</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>TimeTracker3 uses Projects and Work Streams to record the goals to which 
	people dedicate their working hours.</p>
<p>

<h2>Projects</h2>
<p>A Project is an achievable goal which, in order to achieve it, requires some 
effort dedicated to it. TimeTracker3 does not concern itself with project 
management (which can be performed by any means chosen by a particular 
organisation or team) - just with tracking the time and effort dedicated to each 
Project with as much accuracy as possible.</p>
<p>For a Project, the TimeTracker3 records:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - a short descriptive name identifying the 
	specific Project.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - a longer description, providing 
	additional information on what a specific Project is all about. Just what to 
	record depends on the organisation and/or team which works on the project, 
	but can include things like links to the Project's Git repository or Wiki 
	pages, elaborated project statement, etc.</li>
	<li><strong>Parent/child</strong> links - TimeTracker3 organises Projects 
	into a hierarchy, where higher-level projects can be sub-divided into 
	sub-projects, and so on. This allows e.g. integration of effort spent on 
	smaller sub-projects to get an accurate picture on how well the higher-level 
	projects fare.</li>
	<li><strong>Completion status</strong> - a Project marked "completed" will 
	normally disallow booking any more working time towards it. TimeTracker3 can 
	be configured to hide these "completed" projects from view, thus allowing 
	the user to see a clearer picture of what is currently underway.</li>
	<li><strong>Activity links</strong> - an Activity (or a Task) can be 
	assigned to a specific Project. This means that anyone working on that 
	Activity or Task contributes to the Project in question.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Work streams</h2>
<p>Like a Project, a Work Stream is a goal towards which time and effort can be 
spent. Unlike Projects, Work Streams do not have a "completion status", but 
record the related effort on an ongoing basis. Also, unlike Projects, Work 
Streams do not form a hierarchy but instead are treated as a flat list of 
ongoing goals,</p>
<p>Similarly to Projects, Work Streams can be associated with Activities and 
Tasks, allowing to later see just how much effort was spent contributing to a 
specific Work Stream.</p>
