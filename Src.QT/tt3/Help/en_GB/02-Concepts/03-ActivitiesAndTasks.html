<h1>Activities and Tasks</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>TimeTracker3 uses Activities and Tasks to record the kinds of activity 
	users can spend their working time on.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Activities and Tasks" height="100%" src="../../images/ActivitiesAndTasks.png" width="100%" /></p>
<h2>Activities</h2>
<p>An Activity is an indication of what kind of work the user can be performing 
at some given moment. Examples of Activities are such as "Meetings", "Writing 
documentation", or even "Lunch break". Once a TimeTracker workspace is properly 
set up, the user can indicate the moment when they started or stopped the 
corresponding Activity by a single mouse click (or, if the user's screen has 
touch recognition functions, a single tap on the screen). In this the 
TimeTracker is very similar to the classical chess clock - only the number of 
buttons on the clock can vary with the time, based on what any specific user 
does during&nbsp; different periods of time.</p>
<p>For an Activity, the following information is kept:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - a short descriptive name identifying the 
	specific Activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - a longer description, providing 
	additional information on what a specific Activity is all about. For some 
	Activities (such as "Lunch break") the description will not even be 
	necessary while for others (such as "Code refactoring" and "Performance 
	improvements") the description can e.g. provide guidelines as to what 
	actions are considered belonging to each of the Activities.</li>
	<li><strong>Activity type</strong> - all Activities can, and usually will, 
	be associated with specific Activity Types (see below). These provide 
	categorisation of Activities into broad classes (such as "Development", 
	"Documentation", "Meetings", "R&amp;R", etc.)</li>
	<li><strong>Workload</strong> - an Activity can be associated with a 
	"workload" (see below), which represents a work stream towards which time 
	spent on that Activity contributes. This allows collecting information on 
	how much overall time was dedicated to each project, thus helping to better 
	manage the working time of individuals and teams.</li>
	<li><strong>Commenting requirements</strong> - an Activity may be configured 
	to require the user to enter a comment when starting and/or stopping the 
	activity. Examples of activity start/stop comments are situations like 
	"Record the reason for starting code refactoring" or "Record the caller's 
	name after an urgent support-related phone call".</li>
	<li><strong>Reminder requirements</strong> - an Activity may be configured 
	to present a full-screen reminder while that Activity is underway. A typical 
	example here would be a "Lunch break" or "Meeting" Activities, where the 
	user goes away from their computer and must, when returning to it, not 
	forget to indicate that the away time is now over and the actual work begins 
	again.</li>
	<li><strong>Timeout</strong> - when the user leaves for good (for example, 
	at the end of a working day), they may sometimes forget to "stop" their 
	current activity, which will then continue ticking overnight, thus 
	introducing inaccuracy to working time measurement. To prevent that, an 
	Activity may be configured with an "inactivity timeout" - a period of time 
	after which, if there is no user activity on the computer where TimeTracker3 
	runs, the latter considers the user as having left and automatically records 
	the end of the currently ticking Activity at the date and time when the last 
	user activity was noticed. <strong>NOTE THAT</strong> for Activities not 
	explicitly configured with an "inactivity timeout" the default timeout can 
	also be configured on a per-User bases.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Tasks</h2>
<p>Tasks are very similar to Activities in that they also indicate what the 
user's efforts are being spent on. Tasks are different from Activities in two 
respects:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Unlike Activities, which are organised into a simple list from which the 
	"current" Activity can be chosen to work on, Tasks are organised into a
	<strong>hierarchy</strong>, where upper-level tasks can have sub-tasks 
	which, in turn, can have their own sub-tasks, and so on.</li>
	<li>A Task has, in addition to all the properties of an Activity, a <strong>
	completion status</strong>, which is an indication of whether that Task has 
	been completed or not. This simplifies user's lives by separating the 
	Tasks-to-be-completed from the Tasks-already-completed; TimeTracker can (and 
	usually will) be configured to show only the not-yet-completed Tasks so that 
	the user can better dedicate the working time to those.</li>
	<li>A Task also has a <strong>commenting requirement</strong> - when a user 
	marks a given Task as "completed", the Task in question may require the user 
	to enter the short comment, typically about <em>why</em> the Task is being 
	marked as "completed". Typical comments will be e.g. "done and tested", "no 
	longer relevant" or even "Task rejected after a meeting".</li>
</ul>
<h2>Public and private Activities and Tasks</h2>
<p>Both Activities and Tasks can be "public" or "private":</p>
<ul>
	<li>A <strong>public Activity or Task</strong> is visible to all users who 
	can login to the TimeTracker3 workspace. These are organisation-wide things 
	like a "Lunch break" Activity or "Preparation for a 2025 world conference on 
	XYZ" Task.</li>
	<li>A <strong>private Activity or Task</strong> are visible only to the User 
	to whom they belong. These represent the personal backlog of that User.</li>
</ul>
