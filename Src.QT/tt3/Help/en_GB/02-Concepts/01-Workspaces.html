<h1>Workspaces</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>A TimeTracker3 Workspace is a container where daily activity data are 
	recorded and can subsequently be observed, reported on, etc.</p>
<h2>Why use workspaces</h2>
<p>Using Workspaces (as opposed to e.g. single files where daily activity notes 
are taken) offers several advantages, such as:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Allowing organisations and teams to use a standardised solution for 
	recording (and reporting on) their daily activities, instead of each worker 
	doing that by their own means.</li>
	<li>Imposing unified access control rules on the daily activities 
	information.</li>
	<li>Allowing easily integrating recorded daily activities data into combined 
	reports.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Types of workspaces</h2>
<p>Depending on the needs of a concrete project or organisation, a TimeTracker 
workspace can be:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A single file residing on a local or remote drive - this is a 
	lightweight solution for small teams or individual developers.</li>
	<li>A database residing on a local or shared server - this is an effective 
	solution for larger organisations where multiple people from multiple 
	departments all track their daily activities simultaneously.</li>
	<li>A dedicated TimeTracker3 "storage server", which separates the worker's 
	computers from the actual data storage, allowing the two to communicate 
	securely over a WAN - this is best suited to large and internationally 
	distributed organisations which make TimeTracker3 a business-wise working 
	time recording solution.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the options chosen, the concrete TimeTracker3 installation may 
be configured with only these types of Workspaces which are actually needed.</p>
