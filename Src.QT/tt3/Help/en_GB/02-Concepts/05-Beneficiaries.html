<h1>Beneficiaries</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>In TimeTracker3 a Beneficiary represents an external entity who "benefits 
	from" the effort spent (and recorded) by the team members. Ultimately, these 
	are the entities who are billed for the team members' working time.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Projects and Work Streams" height="100%" src="../../images/Domain/ProjectsAndWorkStreams.png" width="100%" /></p>
<p>For a Beneficiary, the following information is kept:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - a short descriptive name identifying the 
	specific Beneficiary.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - a longer description, providing 
	additional information on what a specific Beneficiary is.</li>
	<li><strong>Project links</strong> - by associating Beneficiaries with 
	Projects TimeTracker3 keeps track on how much time and effort was dedicated 
	to a specific Beneficiary (and must, therefore, be booked as expenses 
	towards that Beneficiary).</li>
</ul>
