<h1>TimeTracker3 concepts</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>TimeTracker3 is organised around a basic set of concepts, such as:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Users and Accounts</strong> - these define accessibility and 
	  access rights for different peoiple within an organisation.</li>
	  <li><strong>Activities and tasks</strong> - these are things people can be 
	  "working on", and it is the time spent on these activities and tasks that 
	  TimeTracker3 records.</li>
	  <li><strong>Workflows and beneficiaries</strong> - TODO</li>
	  <li><strong>Live reports</strong> - TimeTracker3 allows users to see their daily 
	  progress with their activities and tasks (e.g. how much time was dedicated 
	  to meetings? how much to their current project? or a mundane lunch break?...and 
	  so on.)</li>
	  <li><strong>Reports</strong> - TimeTracker3 will, when asked to, generate 
	  aggregated reports on the workers' performance - how much time was 
	  dedicated to each project, how that benefits the projects' target 
	  audiences and whom to bill for what.</li>
	</ul>
