<h1>Users and accounts</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>In TimeTracker3 Users and Accounts provide basis for access control.</p>
	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Users </strong>represent real people or groups of people that 
	  are authorised to access specific TimeTracker3 workspaces, while.</li>
	  <li><strong>Accounts</strong> represent the roles that a TimeTracker3 User 
	  can play within a given TimeTracker3 workspace. </li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Users</h2>
<p>A User will normally represent a real person (e.g. "John Doe") but may 
sometimes also represent a group of related person (e.g. "Guest"). In either 
case, the following information is kept for a User:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The User's "real name".</li>
	<li>The list of the User's e-mail addresses.</li>
	<li>The language preferred by that User when working with TimeTracker3 (if 
	different from the host OS' default language).</li>
	<li>The list of activities and tasks that User can "work on".</li>
	<li>The "inactivity time" limit, which specifies how long the user can be 
	inactive (i.e. no mouse or keyboard activity) before TimeTracker3 assumes 
	that the user has left for good and will e.g. stop recording the activity 
	that is "currently underway" for that user.</li>
	<li>The User's enabled/disabled status.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accounts</h2>
<p>An Account represents a specific role a User can play in the TimeTracker3 
universe and always belongs to a specific User. It is not uncommon for a single 
User to have multiple Accounts, in situations like:</p>
<ul>
	<li>A User representing a person who, apart from recording their daily 
	activities like any other User would, can also perform e.g. administrative 
	or backup operator activities. In this case, such User will have several 
	Accounts - one for everyday work and another for e.g. Administrator access.</li>
	<li>A User representing a group of related people, such as "Guests", with 
	each Account representing a different person with a separate login 
	credentials. This allows TimeTracker3 to record the daily activities of 
	these people separately.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following information is kept for an Account:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The Account's login identifier and password.</li>
	<li>The list of the Account's e-mail addresses.</li>
	<li>The Accounts "capabilities", which specify what sorts of actions the 
	owner of that Account can perform in a TimeTracker3 workspace (things like 
	"log daily work", "manage available projects", "generate reports", and so 
	on).</li>
	<li>The Account's enabled/disabled status.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Enabling and disabling </h2>
<p>Both Users and Accounts start off as "enabled", but can later be "disabled".</p>
<p>Disabling an Account disallows logging in to a TimeTracker3 workspace with 
that Account's login credentials. Similarly, disabling a User disallows logging 
in using any of that User's Accounts.</p>
<p>Disabling outdated Users and Accounts, as opposed to deleting them, allows 
TimeTracker3 to keep accurate historical records of e.g. the effort spent on any 
specific Project.</p>
<p>So, if somebody is no longer expected to be active within a given 
TimeTracker3 workspace:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Disable the corresponding User, if that User represents the person in 
	question (such as "John Doe"), or</li>
	<li>Disable the corresponding Account if e.g. the User represents a group of 
	related roles (such as "Guests").</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that a disabled User or Account can be re-enabled again, but doing so 
will require an "administrator" capability in the TimeTracker3 workspace where 
the User/Account is re-enabled.</p>
<h2>The workspace administrator</h2>
<p>In every TimeTracker3 workspace there always exists at least one (but maybe 
more) "workspace administrators". This is:</p>
<ol>
	<li>An enabled User, which has</li>
	<li>At least one enabled Account, which has</li>
	<li>At least the "administrator" capability.</li>
</ol>

<p>Any attempt to disable (or delete) the last available "workspace 
administrator" will be blocked by TimeTracker3, as will an attempt to remove the 
"administrator" capability from the Account in question.</p>
