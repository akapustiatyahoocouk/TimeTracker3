<h1>Introducing TimeTracker3</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>TimeTracker3 is a tool that allows a computer user to 
	record their daily progress through various activities they have to 
	undertake.</p>
	<p>TimeTracker3 was originally designed to meet the needs of software engineers and 
	developers, who have to perform many different tasks during their working 
	hours, switching from one to another; however, it can be useful for e.g. 
	office workers - or, indeed, anyone who needs to do many things at once and 
	to keep track of how their time is used.</p>
	<p>The key features of TimeTracker3 are:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Ease of use.</li>
	  <li>Portability.</li>
	  <li>Localisation.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Ease of use</h2>

    <hr/>
    <p>Before TimeTracker3 was born, a prototype (TimeTracker) was created and used in 
	real-life projects, both commercial and open source, for several years. That 
	gave a unique perspective to what was done right in the first place, what 
	features needed to be added, and what features needed to change to better 
	suit the needs of a TimeTracker3 user.</p>
    
    <h2>Portability</h2>
	<p>TimeTracker3 is written in C++/Qt. This means that it can be used on any platform 
	that supports Qt 6.10 or later - this includes Windows (10/11), Linux 
	(GNOME and KDE UIs), and MacOS. TimeTracker3 has, in fact, been successfully tested 
	on all these platforms.</p>
    
    <h2>Localisation</h2>
	<p>TimeTracker3 is designed from the ground up to be usable internationally. It will 
	"speak" the language of your choice; additional language packs can be added 
	to a TimeTracker3 installation as needed.</p>
<h2>A tool, not a web application</h2>
<p>TimeTracker3 is a locally installed tool (and not a web application, which 
are popular) because:</p>
<ul>
	<li>It is specifically required to handle the "offline" situations, where 
	someone may need to temporarily work in an environment where access to 
	Internet is absent (no connection at all) or limited (blocked depending on 
	e.g. country). For a web application these situations are a showstopper. 
	TimeTracker3 will allow its user to continue recording the daily work 
	locally and later, when it becomes possible, to "merge" their records into 
	the "main/organisation" workspace.</li>
	<li>It requires tight integration with the underlying platform for several 
	of its key features. One example is detecting when the user has left the 
	computer (AFK, away-from-keyboard") - simply recognising the fact that user 
	has not interacted with TimeTracker3 for a long time is not enough - the 
	user may be busy doing their daily work, such as "development" or 
	"dev-testing"), which TimeTracker3 must remain ticking in the background, 
	recording the time.</li>
	<li>A web application will not work in an environment where heightened 
	security is required, such as an organisation where internal security policy 
	prohibits enabling client-side JavaScript, or a situation where certain key 
	computers are not connected to a network at all.</li>
</ul>
