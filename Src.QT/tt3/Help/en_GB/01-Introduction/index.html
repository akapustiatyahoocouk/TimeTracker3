<h1>Introducing TimeTracker3</h1>
    <hr>
    
    <p>TimeTracker3 is a tool that allows a computer user to 
	record their daily progress through various activities they have to 
	undertake.</p>
	<p>TimeTracker3 was originally designed to meet the needs of software engineers and 
	developers, who have to perform many different tasks during their working 
	hours, switching from one to another; however, it can be useful for e.g. 
	office workers - or, indeed, anyone who needs to do many things at once and 
	to keep track of how their time is used.</p>
	<p>The key features of TimeTracker3 are:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>Ease of use.</li>
	  <li>Portability.</li>
	  <li>Localisation.</li>
	</ul>
    
    <h2>Ease of use</h2>

    <hr/>
    <p>Before TimeTracker3 was born, a prototype (TimeTracker) was created and used in 
	real-life projects, both commercial and open source, for several years. That 
	gave a unique perspective to what was done right in the first place, what 
	featurtes needed to be added, and what features needed to change to better 
	suit the needs of a TimeTracker3 user.</p>
    
    <h2>Portability</h2>
	<p>TimeTracker3 is written in C++/Qt. This means that it can be used on any platform 
	that supports Qt 6.10 or later - this includes Windows (10/11), Linux 
	(GNOME and KDE UIs), and MacOS. TimeTracker3 has, in fact, been successfully tested 
	on all these platforms.</p>
    
    <h2>Localisation</h2>
	<p>TimeTracker3 is designed from the ground up to be usable internationally. It will 
	"speak" the language of your choice; additional language packs can be added 
	to a TimeTracker3 installation as needed.</p>
