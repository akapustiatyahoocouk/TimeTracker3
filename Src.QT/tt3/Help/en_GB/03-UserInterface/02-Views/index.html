<h1>Views</h1>
<hr />
<p>A "view" is a visual way to organize a certain activity; common examples are 
"manage accounts", "enter new tasks that can be worked on", "record work and 
enter comments" or "view quick summary of the current working day".</p>
<p>TimeTracker3 comes with a predefined set of views, most of which are 
accessible from every skin. These are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Users/Accounts view.</li>
	<li>Activity Types view.</li>
	<li>Public Activities view.</li>
	<li>Public Tasks view.</li>
	<li>Private Activities view.</li>
	<li>Private Task view.</li>
	<li>Projects view.</li>
	<li>Work Streams view.</li>
	<li>Beneficiaries view.</li>
	<li>My Day view.</li>
	<li>Quick Reports view.</li>
</ul>
<p>The means of accessing a specific view vary depending on the skin. For 
example, in "Administrator" skin all views are presented as tabs in a single&nbsp; 
window where user can switch between the views by selecting the required tab or 
pressing the corresponding hotkey, while in "Sklim" skin all views are available 
as modal popup dialogs.</p>
