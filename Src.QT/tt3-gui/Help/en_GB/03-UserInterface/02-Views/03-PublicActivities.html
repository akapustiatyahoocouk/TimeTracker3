<h1>Public Activities view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Public Activities view allows management of Public Activities (subject to access 
permissions granted after login). These are Activities available to any user who 
can login to a TimeTracker3 workspace.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Public Activities view" height="331" src="../../../images/Views/03-PublicActivities.png" width="653" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Public Activities view allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Public activities list</strong> - this displays the list of 
	available Public Activities. Normally all Public Activities will be visible 
	to all users; however, if the corresponding User is configured to only be 
	allowed to work on specific Public Activities, then such user will only be 
	able to see these configured Public Activities but not the other existing 
	Public Activities.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Public Activities or to quickly find a specific Public Activity. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Public Activity name.</li>
	<li><strong>Create public activity</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Public Activity. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage Public 
	Activities 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify public activity</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Public Activity currently selected in the Public Activities list. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Public Activities capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy public activity</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Public Activity currently selected in the Public Activities list. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	affects all Work items and Events logged against that Public Activity. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
	<li><strong>Start public activity</strong> - use this button to start 
	recording the currently selected Public Activity. If any Activity or Task 
	was already being recorded, its recording is automatically stopped and the 
	corresponding Work item is logged into the workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Stop public activity</strong> - use this button to stop 
	recording the Public Activity that is currently being recorded. This button 
	will only be available when such a Public Activity is selected in the Public 
	Activities list.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a Public Activity is being recorded, the corresponding item in the 
Public Activities list will be highlighted and its recorded duration will be 
displayed alongside the item and updated live.</p>
<p>Note that only one activity can be recorded at any given time. Therefore, if 
e.g. a Public Task or a Private Activity is being recorded, starting a Public 
Activity will stop and log the previously active recording, logging the 
corresponding Work item.</p>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Public Activities list allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify, destroy, start or stop Public Activities) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Public Activities list items are right-clicked.</p>
