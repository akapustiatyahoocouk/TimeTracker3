<h1>Public Tasks view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Public Tasks view allows management of Public Tasks (subject to access 
permissions granted after login). These are Tasks available to any user who 
can login to a TimeTracker3 workspace.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Public Tasks view" height="377" src="../../../images/en_GB/Views/04-PublicTasks.png" width="654" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Public Tasks view allow the user to access:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Public tasks tree</strong> - this displays the tree of 
	available Public Tasks. Normally all Public Tasks will be visible 
	to all users; however, if the corresponding User is configured to only be 
	allowed to work on specific Public Tasks, then such user will only be 
	able to see these configured Public Tasks but not the other existing 
	Public Tasks.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Public Tasks or to quickly find a specific Public Task. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Public Task name. If some 
	sub-task of a Public Task matches the filter but its parent Public Task does 
	not, the parent Public Task will still be displayed, but will be grayed out.</li>
	<li><strong>Show completed tasks</strong> - if un-checked, Public Tasks 
	marked as "completed" will not appear in the Public Tasks tree. An exception 
	to this rule is a "completed" Public Task that has an "un-completed" 
	sub-task - such a "completed" parent will appear in the Public Tasks tree 
	but will be grayed out and visually marked as "completed".</li>
	<li><strong>Create public task</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Public Task. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage Public 
	Tasks 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify public task</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Public Task currently selected in the Public Tasks tree. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Public Tasks capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy public task</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Public Task currently selected in the Public Tasks tree. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	destroys all its sub-tasks and all Work items and Events logged against that Public 
	Task and its sub-tasks. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
	<li><strong>Start public task</strong> - use this button to start 
	recording the currently selected Public Task. If any Activity or Task 
	was already being recorded, its recording is automatically stopped and the 
	corresponding Work item is logged into the workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Stop public task</strong> - use this button to stop 
	recording the Public Task that is currently being recorded. This button 
	will only be available when such a Public Task is selected in the Public 
	Tasks tree.</li>
	<li><strong>Complete public task</strong> - use this button to mark the 
	selected Public Task as "completed". The Public Task may be configured to 
	require the user to enter a comment when it is being completed; if this is 
	so, then the comment entry dialog will pop up. NOTE that a "completed" 
	Public Task may be "un-completed" in order to resume working on it, but this 
	will require Administrator capability (i.e. the Manage Public Tasks 
	capability will not be sufficient). This ensures that the proper Public Task 
	workflow is observed but also allows taking care of e.g. erroneous or 
	accidental completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a Public Task is being recorded, the corresponding item in the 
Public Tasks tree will be highlighted and its recorded duration will be 
displayed alongside the item and updated live.</p>
<p>Note that only one activity can be recorded at any given time. Therefore, if 
e.g. a Public Activity or a Private Task is being recorded, starting a Public 
Task will stop and log the previously active recording, logging the 
corresponding Work item.</p>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Public Tasks tree allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify, destroy, start, stop or complete Public Tasks) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Public Tasks tree items are right-clicked.</p>
