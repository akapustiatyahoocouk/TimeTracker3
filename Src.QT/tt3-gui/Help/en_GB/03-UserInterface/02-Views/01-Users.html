<h1>Users/Accounts view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Users/Accounts view allows management of Users and Accounts (subject to access 
permissions granted after login).</p>
<p>
<img alt="Users view" height="403" src="../../../images/Views/01-Users.png" width="655" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Users view allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Users/Accounts tree</strong> - this displays the list of 
	available Users and their Accounts. Exactly what "available" means depends 
	on what access rights are granted by the current login credentials (as 
	specified during the login procedure) - for ordinary users these will 
	include only the User themselves plus that User's Accounts, while for an 
	administrator this will include all Users and Accounts defined in the 
	workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Users/Accounts or to quickly find a specific User or Account. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the User or Account name. If some 
	Account matches the filter but its User does not, the User will still be 
	displayed, but will be grayed out.</li>
	<li><strong>Show disabled users and accounts</strong> - unless checked, the 
	Users/Accounts tree will not show Users and Accounts that are "disabled". If 
	some User is "disabled" but its Account is not, the User will still be 
	shown, but will be grayed out.</li>
	<li><strong>Create user</strong> - use this button to create a new User. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage Users 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify user</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the User currently selected in the Users/Accounts tree. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Users capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy user</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the User currently selected in the Users/Accounts tree. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	destroys all Accounts of that User along with all Work units and Events 
	logged on behalf of these Accounts, thus removing some parts of the 
	activities history. The destroy confirmation dialog that pops up will show 
	just how much the recorded work history will be impacted. Therefore, it is 
	highly recommended that Users are "disabled" rather than destroyed when they 
	e.g. leave the company.</li>
	<li><strong>Create account</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Account for the User currently selected in the Users/Accounts tree. This 
	will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage Users 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify account</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Account currently selected in the Users/Accounts tree. The meaning of 
	this button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user 
	has logged in with Administrator or Manage Users capability and whether or 
	not the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy a</strong>user - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the User currently selected in the Users/Accounts tree. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	destroys all Accounts of that User along with all Work units and Events 
	logged on behalf of these Accounts, thus removing some parts of the 
	activities history. The destroy confirmation dialog that pops up will show 
	just how much the activities history will be impacted. Therefore, it is 
	highly recommended that Users are "disabled" rather than destroyed when they 
	e.g. leave the company.</li>
	<li><strong>Modify account</strong> - use this button to view or modify the 
	User or Account currently selected in the Users/Accounts tree. The meaning 
	of this button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current 
	user has logged in with Administrator or Manage Users capability and whether 
	or not the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy account</strong> - use this button to permanently 
	destroy the Account currently selected in the Users/Accounts tree. You will 
	be asked to confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in 
	that it also destroys all Work units and Events logged on behalf of this 
	Account, thus removing some parts of the activities history. The destroy 
	confirmation dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work 
	history will be impacted. Therefore, it is highly recommended that Accounts 
	are "disabled" rather than destroyed when they e.g. leave the company.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that any user will always be able to view (in a read-only workspace) or 
modify (in a writable workspace) their own User and Account, regardless&nbsp;of what 
capabilities are granted by the login credentials. However, for Accounts the 
modification of login identifier and access rights will still require 
Administrator or Manage Users capability (while changing the Account's e.g. 
password will not).</p>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Users/Accounts tree allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify or destroy User/Account) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Users/Accounts tree items are right-clicked.</p>
