<h1>Activity Types view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Activity Types view allows management of Activity Types (subject to access 
permissions granted after login).</p>
<p>
<img alt="Activity Types view" height="273" src="../../../images/Views/02-ActivityTypes.png" width="654" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Activity Types view allow the user to access:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Activity types list</strong> - this displays the list of 
	available Activity Types. All Activity Types are always visible to all 
	users.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Activity Types or to quickly find a specific Activity Type. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Activity Type name.</li>
	<li><strong>Create activity type</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Activity Type. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage Activity 
	Types 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify activity type</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Activity Type currently selected in the Activity Types list. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Activity Types capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy activity type</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Activity Type currently selected in the Activity Types list. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	affects all Work items and Events logged against the Activities of that 
	Type. Although the Activities themselves remain intact, the historical 
	perspective will still be altered as these Activities will no longer be 
	attributed to their respective Activity Type. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Activity Types list allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify or destroy Activity Type) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Activity Types list items are right-clicked.</p>
