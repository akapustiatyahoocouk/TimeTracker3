<h1>Projects view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Projects view allows management of Projects (subject to access 
permissions granted after login). These Projects are available to any user who 
can login to a TimeTracker3 workspace.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Projects view" height="376" src="../../../images/en_GB/Views/07-Projects.png" width="654" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Projects view allow the user to access:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Projects tree</strong> - this displays the tree of 
	available Projects. All Public Tasks will be visible to all users.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Projects or to quickly find a specific Project. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Project name. If some 
	sub-project of a Project matches the filter but its parent Project does 
	not, the parent Project will still be displayed, but will be grayed out.</li>
	<li><strong>Show completed projects</strong> - if un-checked, Projects 
	marked as "completed" will not appear in the Projects tree. An exception 
	to this rule is a "completed" Project that has an "un-completed" 
	sub-projects - such a "completed" parent will appear in the Projects tree 
	but will be grayed out and visually marked as "completed".</li>
	<li><strong>Create project</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Project. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage 
	Workloads 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify project</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Project currently selected in the Projects tree. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Workloads capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy project</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Project currently selected in the Projects tree. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	destroys all its sub-projects and all Work items and Events logged against that 
	Project and its sub-tasks will lose their attribution to the destroyed 
	Projects. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
	<li><strong>Complete project</strong> - use this button to mark the 
	selected Project as "completed". NOTE that a "completed" 
	Project may be "un-completed" in order to resume working on it, but this 
	will require Administrator capability (i.e. the Manage Workloads 
	capability will not be sufficient). This ensures that the proper Project 
	workflow is observed but also allows taking care of e.g. erroneous or 
	accidental completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Projects tree allows invoking the same actions 
(create, modify, destroy or complete Projects) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Projects tree items are right-clicked.</p>
