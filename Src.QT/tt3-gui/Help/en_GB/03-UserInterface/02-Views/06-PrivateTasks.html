<h1>Private Tasks view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Private Tasks view allows management of Private Tasks (subject to access 
permissions granted after login). These are Tasks available to the specific User 
who can login to a TimeTracker3 workspace, with each User having their own set 
of configured Private Tasks.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Private Tasks view" height="335" src="../../../images/en_GB/Views/06-PrivateTasks.png" width="652" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Private Tasks view allow the user to access:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Private tasks tree</strong> - this displays the tree of 
	available Private Tasks. Normally all Private Tasks of the logged in User will be visible; however, if the User is configured to only be 
	allowed to work on specific Private Tasks, then such user will only be 
	able to see these configured Private Tasks but not the other existing 
	Private Tasks. NOTE that someone logging in with an Administrator capability 
	will see all Users and all their Private Tasks.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Private Tasks or to quickly find a specific Private Task. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Private Task name. If some 
	sub-task of a Private Task matches the filter but its parent Private Task does 
	not, the parent Private Task will still be displayed, but will be grayed out.</li>
	<li><strong>Show completed tasks</strong> - if un-checked, Private Tasks 
	marked as "completed" will not appear in the Private Tasks tree. An exception 
	to this rule is a "completed" Private Task that has an "un-completed" 
	sub-task - such a "completed" parent will appear in the Private Tasks tree 
	but will be grayed out and visually marked as "completed".</li>
	<li><strong>Create private task</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Private Task. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage Private 
	Tasks 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify private task</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Private Task currently selected in the Private Tasks tree. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Private Tasks capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy private task</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Private Task currently selected in the Private Tasks tree. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	destroys all its sub-tasks and all Work items and Events logged against that 
	Private 
	Task and its sub-tasks. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
	<li><strong>Start private task</strong> - use this button to start 
	recording the currently selected Private Task. If any Activity or Task 
	was already being recorded, its recording is automatically stopped and the 
	corresponding Work item is logged into the workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Stop private task</strong> - use this button to stop 
	recording the Private Task that is currently being recorded. This button 
	will only be available when such a Private Task is selected in the Private 
	Tasks tree.</li>
	<li><strong>Complete public task</strong> - use this button to mark the 
	selected Private Task as "completed". The Private Task may be configured to 
	require the user to enter a comment when it is being completed; if this is 
	so, then the comment entry dialog will pop up. NOTE that a "completed" 
	Private Task may be "un-completed" in order to resume working on it, but this 
	will require Administrator capability (i.e. the Manage Private Tasks 
	capability will not be sufficient). This ensures that the proper Private Task 
	workflow is observed but also allows taking care of e.g. erroneous or 
	accidental completion.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a Private Task is being recorded, the corresponding item in the 
Private Tasks tree will be highlighted and its recorded duration will be 
displayed alongside the item and updated live.</p>
<p>Note that only one activity can be recorded at any given time. Therefore, if 
e.g. a Public Task or a Private Activity is being recorded, starting a Private 
Task will stop and log the previously active recording, logging the 
corresponding Work item.</p>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Private Tasks tree allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify, destroy, start, stop or complete Private Tasks) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Private Tasks tree items are right-clicked.</p>
