<h1>Quick Report view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Quick Reports view is where user can see a brief report on a short and 
fast summary of some aspect if the user's working day.</p>
<p>

<p>The Quick Report view itself defines the topmost row of controls, which 
include:</p>
<ul>
	<li>The type of the Quick Report that is currently visible. The exact types 
	of available Quick Reports depends on the installed TimeTracjer3 
	configuration.</li>
	<li>Refresh interval - the Quick Reports view allows the user to choose how 
	frequently the displayed Quick Report is refreshed. One of this options is 
	"never", which means the user must refresh manually.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any other controls are specific to the Quick Report type. For example, the 
Daily Work Quick Report allows the user to choose a date for which to display 
activity statistics, to scale the resulting chart and to copy the chart to 
clipboard as a picture in order to later paste it into some document.</p>
<p>Note that Quick Reports, by design, do not change the workspace they are 
created from in any way. In addition, they are specific to the currently logged 
in user and only include information that the user will be able to see in some 
other e.g. view.</p>
