<h1>Private Activities view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Private Activities view allows management of Private Activities (subject to access 
permissions granted after login). These are Activities available to the specific 
User who 
can login to a TimeTracker3 workspace, with each User having their own set of 
configured Private Activities.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Private Activities view" height="374" src="../../../images/en_GB/Views/05-PrivateActivities.png" width="652" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Private Activities view allow the user to access:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Private activities list</strong> - this displays the list of 
	available Private Activities on a per-User basis. Normally only Private Activities 
	of the User itself will be visible 
	to that user; however, if the User is configured to only be 
	allowed to work on specific Private Activities, then such user will only be 
	able to see these configured Private Activities but not the other existing 
	Private Activities. NOTE that someone logging in with an Administrator 
	capability will see all Users and all their Private Activities.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Private Activities or to quickly find a specific Private Activity. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Public Activity name.</li>
	<li><strong>Create private activity</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Private Activity. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage Private 
	Activities 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify private activity</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Private Activity currently selected in the Private Activities list. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Private Activities capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy private activity</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Private Activity currently selected in the Private Activities list. You will be asked to 
	confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation in that it also 
	destroys all Work items and Events logged against that Private Activity. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
	<li><strong>Start private activity</strong> - use this button to start 
	recording the currently selected Private Activity. If any Activity or Task 
	was already being recorded, its recording is automatically stopped and the 
	corresponding Work item is logged into the workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Stop private activity</strong> - use this button to stop 
	recording the Private Activity that is currently being recorded. This button 
	will only be available when such a Private Activity is selected in the 
	Private 
	Activities list.</li>
</ul>
<p>While a Private Activity is being recorded, the corresponding item in the 
Private Activities list will be highlighted and its recorded duration will be 
displayed alongside the item and updated live.</p>
<p>Note that only one activity can be recorded at any given time. Therefore, if 
e.g. a Public Activity or a Private Task is being recorded, starting a Private 
Activity will stop and log the previously active recording, logging the 
corresponding Work item.</p>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Private Activities list allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify, destroy, start or stop Private Activities) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Private Activities list items are right-clicked.</p>
