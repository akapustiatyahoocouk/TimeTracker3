<h1>Work Streams view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Work Streams view allows management of Work Streams (subject to access 
permissions granted after login).</p>
<p>
<img alt="Work Streams view" height="264" src="../../../images/en_GB/Views/08-WorkStreams.png" width="656" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Work Streams view allow the user to access:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Work Streams list</strong> - this displays the list of 
	available Work Streams. All Work Streams are always visible to all 
	users.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Work Streams or to quickly find a specific Work Stream. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Work Stream name.</li>
	<li><strong>Create work stream</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Work Stream. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage 
	Workloads 
	capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify work stream</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Work Stream currently selected in the Work Streams list. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Workloads capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy work stream</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Work Stream currently selected in the Work Streams list. You will be 
	asked to confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation. Although the Activities 
	assigned to the Work Stream themselves remain intact, the historical 
	perspective will still be altered as these Activities will no longer be 
	attributed to their respective Work Stream. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Work Streams list allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify or destroy Work Stream) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Work Streams list items are right-clicked.</p>
