<h1>Beneficiaries view</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Beneficiaries view allows management of Beneficiaries (subject to access 
permissions granted after login).</p>
<p>
<img alt="Beneficiaries view" height="262" src="../../../images/en_GB/Views/09-Beneficiaries.png" width="655" /></p>
<p>The controls in the Beneficiaries view allow the user to access:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Beneficiaries list</strong> - this displays the list of 
	available Beneficiaries. All Beneficiaries are always visible to all 
	users.</li>
	<li><strong>Filter</strong> - type anything here to narrow the set of 
	displayed Beneficiaries or to quickly find a specific Beneficiary. The 
	filter match can appear anywhere within the Beneficiary name.</li>
	<li><strong>Create beneficiary</strong> - use this button to create a new 
	Beneficiary. 
	This will only be permitted to someone with Administrator or Manage 
	Beneficiaries capability and will be disallowed in a read-only workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>View/Modify beneficiary</strong> - use this button to view or modify 
	the Beneficiary currently selected in the Beneficiaries list. The meaning of this 
	button (view or modify) will be determined by whether the current user has 
	logged in with Administrator or Manage Beneficiaries capability and whether or not 
	the workspace is read-only.</li>
	<li><strong>Destroy beneficiary</strong> - use this button to permanently destroy 
	the Beneficiary currently selected in the Beneficiaries list. You will be 
	asked to confirm the destruction, as this is a dangerous operation. Although the Activities 
	assigned to the Projects and Work Streams associated with the Beneficiary remain intact, the historical 
	perspective will still be altered as these Activities will no longer be 
	attributed to their respective Beneficiary. The destroy confirmation 
	dialog that pops up will show just how much the recorded work history will be 
	impacted.</li>
</ul>
<p>As well as action buttons, the Beneficiaries list allows invoking the same 
actions (create, modify or destroy Beneficiary) via the context menus that pop 
up when the Work Streams list items are right-clicked.</p>
