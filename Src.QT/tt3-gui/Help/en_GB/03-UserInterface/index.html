<h1>User intrerface</h1>
<hr />
<p>The user interface of TimeTracker3 is organised around several key concepts:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Skins</strong> - a "skin" is a specific way to present the user 
	interface. Different skins are geared towards different usage scenarios, 
	such as "administration tasks", a "minimal use of the screen estate", and so 
	on. The user working with TimeTracker3 can choose any of the available skins 
	at any moment to concentrate on the tasks the user faces at the moment.</li>
	<li><strong>Views</strong> - a "view" is a visual way to organize a certain 
	activity, such as "manage accounts", "enter new tasks that can be worked 
	on", "record work and enter comments" or "view quick summary of the current 
	working day". Depending on what skin is currently active, these views may be 
	presented in either modal (popup dialogs) or modeless (non-exclusive)&nbsp; 
	windows with which the TimeTracker3 user can interact.</li>
	<li><strong>Dialogs</strong> - these allow the user to perform common tasks 
	- create or open workspaces, activate views, create and adjust activities 
	that can be worked on, invoke tools and reports, and so on. Mote that most 
	dialogs will be common for all skins and views where they are required.</li>
</ul>
