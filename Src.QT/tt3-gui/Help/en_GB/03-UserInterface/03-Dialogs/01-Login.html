<h1>Login dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Login dialog is the first thing the user must interact with when starting 
TimeTracker3. It established the user's credentials, which then are used to 
decide what the user can or cannot do within TimeTracker3.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Login dialog" height="191" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/01-Login.png" width="268" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Login dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Login</strong> - in order to access a certain TimeTracker3 
	workspace, the login provided by the user must match one of the Accounts 
	defined in that workspace. Furthermore, this Account must be enabled and it 
	must belong to the User who is also enabled.</li>
	<li><strong>Password</strong> - TimeTracker3 Accounts are protected by 
	passwords selected arbitrarily by the Account owners.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that user's credentials (login + password) that grant access to one 
TimeTracker3 workspace may or may not grant access to a different workspace; nor 
is the same Account (i.e. an Account with the same login and password) defined 
in two different workspaces required to grant the same access rights.</p>
<p>When, after logging in, the user attempts to open a workspace where the 
specified login credentials do nor grant access, TimeTracker3 will prompt the 
user to enter different credentials, which <em>do</em> grant such access, using 
the same Login dialog.</p>
<p>While working, the user can, at any time, choose to re-login with different 
credentials. A typical example is a power user, who will re-login temporarily 
with extended (or even a full administrator) access rights to perform workspace 
administration tasks (such as workspace backup) and then re-login with their 
everyday credentials to continue the daily work.</p>
<p>When TimeTracker3 runs without a workspace (when first started, or when the 
user forcibly closes the active workspace) the login credentials entered by the 
user are not used - but then no useful work can be done until some workspace is 
opened again (or a new one created).</p>
