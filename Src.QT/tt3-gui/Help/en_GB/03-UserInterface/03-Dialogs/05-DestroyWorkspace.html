<h1>Destroy Workspace dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Workspace dialog is invoked when the user wants to completely 
destroy an already 
existing workspace.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Destroy Workspace dialog" height="191" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/05-DestroyWorkspace.png" width="569" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Destroy&nbsp; Workspace dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Workspace type</strong> - TimeTracker3 allows using a variety of 
	technologies to store workspaces, the simplest one of which is storing the 
	entire workspace in a single XML file in the local file system (this is the 
	choice ideal for individual users who need to track their working time). 
	Other workspace types will be available depending on the installed 
	TimeTracker3 configuration and may range from local (or remote) databases to 
	a full-fledged remote storage.</li>
	<li><strong>Workspace location</strong> - a workspace is uniquely identified 
	by its "location", the exact nature of which varies with the workspace type. 
	For XML file workspaces this will be the full path to the XML file where the 
	workspace resides. Workspace locations are <em>not</em> directly editable; 
	instead, the <strong>Browse</strong> button will pop up the dialog where the 
	user can choose the location of an existing workspace in a manner 
	appropriate for the chosen workspace type.</li>
</ul>
<p>When destroying a workspace, TimeTracker3 will use the current login 
credentials (as previously entered via a Login dialog) to verify access rights - 
within the destroyed workspace these login credentials must belong to an enabled 
"administrator" Account, or the workspace destruction fails.</p>
<p>It is not possible to destroy a workspace that is currently in use. For 
workspace types that offer shared access (such as workspaces residing in a 
shared database or in a remote storage) the workspace in question must not be in 
use by any TimeTracker3 instance running on any machine that can access that 
workspace.</p>
