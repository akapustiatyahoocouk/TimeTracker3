<h1>Create/Modify Beneficiary dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Beneficiaries and modifying existing 
Beneficiaries.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Create/Modify Beneficiaries dialog" height="355" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/28-CreateModifyBeneficiary.png" width="559" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Create/Modify Beneficiary dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - Beneficiaries are identified by short, 
	descriptive names (such as "Myself", "General public" and so on) which must 
	be unique within a given workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - if the Beneficiary name is not 
	self-explanatory, its description may help to clarify its meaning. Multiple 
	lines of text may be entered here.</li>
	<li><strong>Workloads</strong> - a Beneficiary can be associated with one or several 
	Workloads (i.e. Projects or Work Streams) in which that Beneficiary is a 
	stakeholder. This 
	field lists the Beneficiary's associated Projects and Work Streams and provides a Select 
	button to set up and modify that association as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only someone with Administrator or Manage Beneficiaries capabilities is 
allowed to create or modify Beneficiaries. However, anyone who can log into a 
given workspace can see all Beneficiaries defined there.</p>
