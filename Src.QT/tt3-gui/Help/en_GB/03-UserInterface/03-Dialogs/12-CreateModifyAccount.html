<h1>Create/Modify Account dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Accounts and modifying existing 
Accounts.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Create/Modify Account dialog" height="602" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/12-CreateModifyAccount.png" width="647" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Create/Modify Account dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>User</strong> - specifies the Use to which the Account belongs. 
	It can be freely chosen when creating a new Account; however, TimeTracker3 
	does not currently allow re-parenting an Account to another User.</li>
	<li>L<strong>ogin</strong> - each Account is uniquely identified by its 
	"login", which must be unique within the containing workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Password</strong> and <strong>Confirm Password</strong> - in 
	TimeTracker3 Accounts are password-protected. The user is required to type 
	in the same password twice when creating a new Account or changing a 
	password for an existing Account; this helps prevent unintended typing 
	errors when entering the password.</li>
	<li><strong>E-mail addresses</strong> - One or more e-mail addresses can be 
	associated with an Account. These are utilized when e.g. auto-mailing 
	notifications (or simply to distinguish different persons who happen to have 
	the same names). Use <strong>Add</strong>, <strong>Modify</strong> and
	<strong>Remove</strong> buttons to manage the list of Account's e-mail 
	addresses. If the Account does not specify any e-mail addresses, the list of 
	e-mail addresses is implicitly inherited from the Account's parent User.</li>
	<li><strong>Capabilities</strong> - these check boxes define the sorts of 
	operations someone logged in with that Account can and cannot perform. The 
	available capabilities are:<ul>
		<li><strong>Administrator</strong> - allows the account holder to do 
		anything within the workspace, including management of private assets of 
		the Users defined therein.</li>
		<li><strong>Manage users</strong> - allows the account holder th create, 
		modify and destroy Users and Accounts.</li>
		<li><strong>Manage activity types</strong> - allows the account holder 
		to create, modify and destroy "activity types", which is normally the 
		project manager's responsibility. A user without that capability will be 
		able to refer to the existing activity types, but not to create, modify 
		or destroy them.</li>
		<li><strong>Manage beneficiaries</strong> - allows the account holder to 
		create, modify and manage Beneficiaries. These represent external 
		entities who act as stakeholders in the projects that are being worked 
		on (and who will ultimately be billed for the effort dedicated to these 
		projects).</li>
		<li><strong>Manage workloads</strong> - allows the account holder to 
		create, modify and destroy Projects and Work Streams. These represent 
		the targets that daily efforts strive to achieve,</li>
		<li><strong>Manage public activities</strong> - allows the account 
		holder to create, modify and destroy Public Activities. Without this 
		capability, the user will be limited to logging Work items only against 
		the already existing Public Activities.</li>
		<li><strong>Manage public tasks</strong> - allows the account holder to 
		create, modify and destroy Public Tasks. Without this capability, the 
		user will be limited to logging Work items only against the already 
		existing Public Tasks. This specifically relates to marking a Public 
		Task as "completed".</li>
		<li><strong>Manage private activities</strong> - allows the account 
		holder to create, modify and destroy their own Private Activities. 
		Without this capability, the user will be limited to logging Work items 
		only against the already existing Private Activities.</li>
		<li><strong>Manage private tasks</strong> - allows the account holder to 
		create, modify and destroy their own Private Tasks. Without this 
		capability, the user will be limited to logging Work items only against 
		the already existing Private Tasks. This specifically relates to marking 
		a Private Task as "completed".</li>
		<li><strong>Log work</strong> - allows the account holder to log Work 
		items against available Activities and Tasks by "starting" one of them 
		before working on it and later "stopping" the Activity or Task when 
		switching to doing something else.</li>
		<li><strong>Log events</strong> - allows the account holder to log 
		arbitrary comments into the work log. These do not contribute to the 
		history of effort (as Work items do), but may be used to attach 
		arbitrary notes to the daily log.</li>
		<li><strong>Generate reports</strong> - allows the account holder to 
		generate various reports. This capability is typically required by a 
		team manager or project manager. Note that this capability does not 
		apply to Quick Reports, which will always show only what the account 
		holder is allowed to see during the normal daily operations. If granted, 
		this capability applies to all available reports.</li>
		<li><strong>Backup and restore</strong> - allows the account holder to 
		perform workspace backup and restore operations. This is typically the 
		responsibility of the system administrator.</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Enabled</strong> - by default, all Accounts are created as 
	"enabled". "Disabling" an Accountwillldisallow logging in to the TimeTracker3 
	workspace using any of that User's Accounts. NOTE that it is not possible to 
	disable the last workspace administrator User.Account.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally an Administrator or Manage Users capability is required to create 
new Accounts and modify existing Accounts. The only exception to this rule is that 
anyone who has an Account in a given workspace and who logs into TimeTracker3 
using that Account will be able to modify <em>some</em> of the details of the 
Account in question, specifically - the Account's password and e-mail addresses 
(but not the Account's login, capabilities or enabled status).</p>
