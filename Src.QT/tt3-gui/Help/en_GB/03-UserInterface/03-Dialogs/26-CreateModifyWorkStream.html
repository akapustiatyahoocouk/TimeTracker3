<h1>Create/Modify Work Stream dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Work Streams and modifying existing 
Work Streams.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Create/Modify Work Stream dialog" height="355" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/26-CreateModifyWorkStream.png" width="567" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Create/Modify Work Stream dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - Work Streams are identified by short, 
	descriptive names (such as "Code cleanup", "ISO certification" and so on) which must 
	be unique within a given workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - if the Work Stream name is not 
	self-explanatory, its description may help to clarify its meaning. Multiple 
	lines of text may be entered here.</li>
	<li><strong>Beneficiaries</strong> - a Work Stream can be associated with one 
	(usually) or several Beneficiaries, who are the Work Stream's stakeholders. This 
	field lists the Work Stream's associated Beneficiaries and provides a Select 
	button to set up and modify that association as necessary.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only someone with Administrator or Manage Workloads capabilities is 
allowed to create or modify Work Streams. However, anyone who can log into a 
given workspace can see all Work Streams defined there.</p>
