<h1>Destroy User dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy User dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing User.</p>
<p>

<p>
When destroying a User, all of that User's Accounts ill be destroyed along with 
the User. What's more, any Work items and comments logged for these Accounts 
will also be destroyed. The Destroy User dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the User's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Users capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Users. Specifically, a user cannot destroy themselves otherwise.</p>
<p>
Since destroying Users (and affecting the recorded work history) is a very 
dangerous operation, it is strongly recommended that Users who e.g. leave the 
company are "disable" rather than destroyed.</p>
