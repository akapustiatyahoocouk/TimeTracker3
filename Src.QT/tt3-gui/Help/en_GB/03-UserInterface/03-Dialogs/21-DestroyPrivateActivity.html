<h1>Destroy Private Activity dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Private Activity dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Private Activity.</p>
<p>

<p>
When destroying a Private Activity, any Work items and Events recorded for that 
Private Activity will be destroyed along with it. The Destroy Private Activity dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Private Activity's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Private Activities capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Private Activities. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see their own Private Activities unless the User is configured to 
restrict the list of Private Activities that User can work on.</p>
