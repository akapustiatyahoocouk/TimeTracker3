<h1>Destroy Work Stream dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Work Stream&nbsp;dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Work Stream.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Destroy Work Stream dialog" height="223" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/27-DestroyWorkStream.png" width="398" /></p>
<p>
When destroying a Work Stream, any 
Activities and Tasks associated with the destroyed Work Stream will lose that 
association with that Work Stream. As a consequence, any Work items and comments logged for these 
Activities and Tasks 
will lose their attribution to a specific Work Stream. The Destroy Work Stream dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Work Stream's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Workloads capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Work Streams. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see all Work Streams defined there.</p>
