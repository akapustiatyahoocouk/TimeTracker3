<h1>Destroy Actvity Type dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Activity Type&nbsp; dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Actoivity Type.</p>

<p>
When destroying an Activity Type, any Activities and Tasks associated with that 
Activity Type will lose that association. As a consequence, any Work items and comments logged for these 
Activities and Tasks 
will lose their attribution to a specific Activity Type. The Destroy Activity 
Type dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Activity Type's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Activity Types capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Activity Types. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see all Activity Types defined there.</p>
