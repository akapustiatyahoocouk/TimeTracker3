<h1>Manage Quick Picks List dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Manage Quick Picks List dialog allows the user to set up and maintain the 
list of "quick picks" - Activities and Tasks that are most frequently needed 
during the daily work and which the user shall be able to start and stop 
recording with minimum fuss.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Manage Quick Picks List dialog" height="558" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/30-ManageQuickPicksList.png" width="748" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Manage Quick Picks List dialog are used to the following 
effect:</p>
<ul>
	<li>In the upper half of the dialog there are lists of all Activities and 
	Tasks available to the currently logged in user, both Public and Private. 
	Use the tabs to switch between different Activity/Task categories.</li>
	<li>In the lower half of the dialog is the user's current Quick Picks list. 
	Items can be added to or removed from the Quick Picks list by checking or 
	unchecking individual Activities and Tasks from the lists of available 
	Activities and Tasks.</li>
	<li>Each list of available Activities/Tasks comes with a filter field, which 
	acts in a manner similar to the filters in all other TimeTracker3 views - 
	typing anything in this field will restrict the visible list items to those 
	which match the filter anywhere in their names.</li>
	<li>The Quick Picks List is ordered for convenience, because some Quick 
	Picks Activities or Tasks are e.g. more frequently used that the others. The 
	ordering buttons below the Quick Picks List allow moving the currently 
	selected item within the Quick Picks List.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any user is always permitted to set up and manage the Quick Picks List of the 
Account used for logging into TimeTracker3. Changes to Quick Picks List take 
effect immediate after the OK button is pressed to confirm the user's changes 
and close the dialog.</p>
