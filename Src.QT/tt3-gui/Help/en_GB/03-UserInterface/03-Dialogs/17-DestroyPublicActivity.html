<h1>Destroy Public Actvity dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Public Activity dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Public Activity.</p>
<p>

<p>
When destroying a Public Activity, any Work items and Events recorded for that 
Public Activity will be destroyed along with it. The Destroy Public Activity dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Public Activity's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Public Activities capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Public Activities. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see all Public Activities defined there unless the User is configured to 
restrict the list of Public Activities that User can work on.</p>
