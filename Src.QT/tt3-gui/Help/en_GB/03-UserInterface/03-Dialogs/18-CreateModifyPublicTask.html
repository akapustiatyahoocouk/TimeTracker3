<h1>Create/Modify Public Task dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Public Tasks and modifying existing 
Public Tasks.</p>
<p>

<p>The fields in the Create/Modify Public Task dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Parent task</strong> - Public Tasks are organized into a 
	hierarchy where a Public Task can have sub-tasks which, in turn, can have 
	further sub-tasks, and so on. The parent for a Public Task is first chosen 
	when that Public Task is created but&nbsp; can be changed later.</li>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - Public Tasks are identified by short, 
	descriptive names (such as "Create German translation of the UI", "Prepare 
	the project vision document" and so on) which must 
	be unique within a given workspace (if the Public Task is a root Public Task 
	that does not have a parent) or parent (if the Public Task has a parent).</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - if the Public Task name is not 
	self-explanatory, its description may help to clarify its meaning. Multiple 
	lines of text may be entered here.</li>
	<li><strong>Activity type</strong> - use this drop-down list to select the 
	Activity Type to assign the Public Task to.</li>
	<li><strong>Workload</strong> - use this drop-down list and its associated 
	selection button to assign a Public Task to a specific Project or Work 
	Stream. Such assignments help in tracking effort dedicated to individual 
	Projects over a period of time.</li>
	<li><strong>Timeout</strong> - these fields govern what happens if the user 
	starts recording the Public Task but then 
	leaves the computer unattended. If this is to happen, TimeTracker3 may 
	automatically finish the Public Task in question, logging a comment to that 
	effect. NOTE that this behavior overrides any "inactivity timeout" 
	configured for the User as far as the Public Task in question is 
	concerned.</li>
	<li><strong>Require comment when starting/stopping this activity</strong> - 
	these two check boxes specify what happens when the Public Task is 
	started and stopped. If any of the two are checked, then TimeTracker3 will 
	present a popup dialog requesting the user to enter a comment, which is then 
	recorded into the workspace as an Event. If the Activity that is being 
	recorded requires comment when stopped, and the switch is made to recording 
	a Public Task which requires a comment when started, the user is asked to 
	enter the comment only once; such comment is then associated with both old 
	and new recorded Activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Full-screen reminder</strong> - if checked, then starting such a 
	Public Task will pop up a full-screen reminder window stating that the 
	Public Task is underway (and how long it is being recorded for); this 
	popup window will be hidden when the recording of the Public Task is 
	stopped. This is beneficial for Public Tasks which expect the user to 
	leave their workplace (such as "planning meeting for the next sprint", etc.) - having a 
	full-screen reminder helps the user to explicitly stop recording the Public 
	Task, logging an "away from keyboard" Work item and switching to the 
	next Activity to work on.</li>
	<li><strong>Require comment on completion</strong> - if checked, the user 
	will be required to enter a comment when marking the Public Task as 
	"completed".</li>
	<li><strong>Completed</strong> - use this check box to mark the Public Task 
	as "completed". It can also be used to "un-complete" a Public Task, but this 
	action requires an Administrator capability, as it breaks the normal 
	workflow of Public Tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only someone with Administrator or Manage Public Tasks capabilities is 
allowed to create or modify Public Tasks. However, anyone who can log into a 
given workspace can see all Public Tasks defined there. The exception to 
this rule is the case when a specific User is configured to only allow working 
on specific Public Tasks, in which case only these Public Tasks will 
be visible in the tree and all other existing Public Tasks will not be 
visible.</p>
