<h1>Open Workspace dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Open Workspace dialog is invoked when the user wants to open an already 
existing workspace.</p>
<p>

<p>The fields in the Open&nbsp; Workspace dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Workspace type</strong> - TimeTracker3 allows using a variety of 
	technologies to store workspaces, the simplest one of which is storing the 
	entire workspace in a single XML file in the local file system (this is the 
	choice ideal for individual users who need to track their working time). 
	Other workspace types will be available depending on the installed 
	TimeTracker3 configuration and may range from local (or remote) databases to 
	a full-fledged remote storage.</li>
	<li><strong>Workspace location</strong> - a workspace is uniquely identified 
	by its "location", the exact nature of which varies with the workspace type. 
	For XML file workspaces this will be the full path to the XML file where the 
	workspace resides. Workspace locations are <em>not</em> directly editable; 
	instead, the <strong>Browse</strong> button will pop up the dialog where the 
	user can choose the location of an existing workspace in a manner 
	appropriate for the chosen workspace type.</li>
	<li><strong>Open as</strong> - TimeTracker allows to explicitly specify how 
	to open an existing workspace, which can be one of:<ul>
		<li><strong>Default</strong> - workspace will be open in read/write 
		mode, allowing both reading and modification. However, if it is not 
		possible, an attempt will be made to open the workspace in read-only 
		mode.</li>
		<li><strong>Read Only</strong> - workspace will allow only reading from; 
		any modification of the workspace will not be permitted, This is foot 
		for e.g. backing up a workspace or generating reports from it.</li>
		<li><strong>Read/Write</strong> - workspace will allow modifications as 
		well as reading. If the workspace actually exists but only allows read 
		access (for example, when a workspace resides in a read-only file), an 
		attempt to open it in this mode will fail/</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p>When opening a workspace, TimeTracker3 will check whether the current login 
credentials (as previously entered in the Login dialog) grant access to that 
workspace. If not, the user will be given a choice whether to re-login with 
different credentials, that <em>do</em> grant access to the workspace in 
question, or to abandon the workspace opening and remain working with the 
currently open workspace (if there is such).</p>
<p>When switching between workspaces, the previous workspace is cleanly closed 
before switching to the new one. Specifically, if any Activity is in the process 
of being recorded, its recording will stop (and the corresponding Work unit will 
be logged) before the previous workspace is closed.</p>
