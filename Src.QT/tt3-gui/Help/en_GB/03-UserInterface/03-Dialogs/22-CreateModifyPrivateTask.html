<h1>Create/Modify Private Task dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Private Tasks and modifying existing 
Private Tasks.</p>
<p>

<p>The fields in the Create/Modify Private Task dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>User</strong> - a Private Task always belongs to some User. 
	The owner of a Private Task can be chosen when creating a Private 
	Task, but TimeTracker3 does not currently allow re-assigning an existing 
	Private Task to another User.</li>
	<li><strong>Parent task</strong> - Private Tasks are organized into a 
	hierarchy where a Private Task can have sub-tasks which, in turn, can have 
	further sub-tasks, and so on. The parent for a Private Task is first chosen 
	when that Private Task is created but&nbsp; can be changed later.</li>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - Private Tasks are identified by short, 
	descriptive names (such as "Create German translation of the UI", "Prepare 
	the project vision document" and so on) which must 
	be unique for a given User (if the Private Task is a root Private Task 
	that does not have a parent) or parent (if the Private Task has a parent).</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - if the Private Task name is not 
	self-explanatory, its description may help to clarify its meaning. Multiple 
	lines of text may be entered here.</li>
	<li><strong>Activity type</strong> - use this drop-down list to select the 
	Activity Type to assign the Private Task to.</li>
	<li><strong>Workload</strong> - use this drop-down list and its associated 
	selection button to assign a Private Task to a specific Project or Work 
	Stream. Such assignments help in tracking effort dedicated to individual 
	Projects over a period of time.</li>
	<li><strong>Timeout</strong> - these fields govern what happens if the user 
	starts recording the Private Task but then 
	leaves the computer unattended. If this is to happen, TimeTracker3 may 
	automatically finish the Private Task in question, logging a comment to that 
	effect. NOTE that this behavior overrides any "inactivity timeout" 
	configured for the User as far as the Private Task in question is 
	concerned.</li>
	<li><strong>Require comment when starting/stopping this activity</strong> - 
	these two check boxes specify what happens when the Private Task is 
	started and stopped. If any of the two are checked, then TimeTracker3 will 
	present a popup dialog requesting the user to enter a comment, which is then 
	recorded into the workspace as an Event. If the Activity that is being 
	recorded requires comment when stopped, and the switch is made to recording 
	a Private Task which requires a comment when started, the user is asked to 
	enter the comment only once; such comment is then associated with both old 
	and new recorded Activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Full-screen reminder</strong> - if checked, then starting such a 
	Private Task will pop up a full-screen reminder window stating that the 
	Private Task is underway (and how long it is being recorded for); this 
	popup window will be hidden when the recording of the Private Task is 
	stopped. This is beneficial for Private Tasks which expect the user to 
	leave their workplace (such as "meeting with the lawyer", etc.) - having a 
	full-screen reminder helps the user to explicitly stop recording the Private 
	Task, logging an "away from keyboard" Work item and switching to the 
	next Activity to work on.</li>
	<li><strong>Require comment on completion</strong> - if checked, the user 
	will be required to enter a comment when marking the Private Task as 
	"completed".</li>
	<li><strong>Completed</strong> - use this check box to mark the Private Task 
	as "completed". It can also be used to "un-complete" a Private Task, but this 
	action requires an Administrator capability, as it breaks the normal 
	workflow of Private Tasks.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only someone with Administrator or Manage Private Tasks capabilities is 
allowed to create or modify Private Tasks. However, anyone who can log into a 
given workspace can see all of their own Private Tasks. The exception to 
this rule is the case when a specific User is configured to only allow working 
on specific Private Tasks, in which case only these Private Tasks will 
be visible in the tree and all other existing Private Tasks will not be 
visible. NOTE also that an Administrator will be able to see and manage Private 
Tasks of any User.</p>
