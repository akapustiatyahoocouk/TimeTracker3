<h1>Restart dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Restart dialog is invoked when the user explicitly chooses to restart 
TimeTracker3.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Restart dialog" height="177" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/06-Restart.png" width="511" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Restart dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Suppress further confirmations</strong> - in the future, 
	whenever TimeTracker3 is explicitly restarted again, this confirmation 
	dialog will not appear and the user's answer will be assumed to be "yes". 
	This behavior can be reset (so as to explicitly ask confirmation when 
	restarting) in the General/Dialogs page of the Preferences dialog.</li>
</ul>
<p>When restarting TimeTracker3, the currently active workspace is cleanly closed 
before restarting. Specifically, if any Activity is in the process 
of being recorded, its recording will stop (and the corresponding Work unit will 
be logged) before the workspace is closed and restart occurs.</p>
