<h1>Create/Modify User dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Users and modifying existing 
Users.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Create/Modify User dialog" height="467" src="../../../images/Dialogs/10-CreateModifyUser.png" width="618" /></p>
<p>The fields in the Create/Modify User dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Real name</strong> - the actual name of the person or group 
	represented by the User. While TimeTracker3 imposes no requirement that all 
	Users have different "real names", it is recommended that they do so</li>
	<li><strong>E-mail addresses</strong> - One or more e-mail addresses can be 
	associated with a User. These are utilized when e.g. auto-mailing 
	notifications (or simply to distinguish different persons who happen to have 
	the same names). Use <strong>Add</strong>, <strong>Modify</strong> and
	<strong>Remove</strong> buttons to manage the list of User's e-mail 
	addresses.</li>
	<li><strong>Current activity/Stop if unattended</strong> - these fields 
	govern what happens if the user starts recording some Activity and then 
	leaves the computer unattended. If this is to happen, TimeTracker3 may 
	automatically finish the Activity in question, logging a comment to that 
	effect. NOTE that this behavior can be overridden on a per-Activity basis 
	(for example, to specify different inactivity timeouts for different 
	Activities).</li>
	<li><strong>UI locale</strong> - this specifies the language which the 
	TimeTracker3 will use for its GUI when the user logs in using one of that 
	User's Accounts. The default choice is to not use the User-specific UI 
	locale, but to revert to the TimeTracker3's default UI locale which, in 
	turn, starts off as the system UI locale.</li>
	<li><strong>Working on</strong> - these controls restrict the Activities for 
	which the User&nbsp; is allowed to log Work items. If the list is empty, 
	then no restriction is in place and the User can log Work items for any 
	visible Activity (that is, any Public Activity/Task and any of that User's 
	Private Activities/Tasks).</li>
	<li><strong>Enabled</strong> - by default, all Users are created as 
	"enabled". "Disabling" a User will disallow logging in to the TimeTracker3 
	workspace using any of that User's Accounts. NOTE that it is not possible to 
	disable the last workspace administrator User.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally an Administrator or Manage Users capability is required to create 
new Users and modify existing Users. The only exception to this rule is that 
anyone who has an Account in a given workspace and who logs into TimeTracker3 
using that Account will be able to modify the details of the User to which that 
Account belongs.</p>
<p>When a "current Activity" is stopped automatically because the user 
inactivity time exceeds the timeout specified for the current User, the logged 
Work item does <em>not</em> include the timeout period itself. So, for example, 
when the User's timeout is set to 1 hour and the user starts some Activity, 
works for 2 hours and then leave the office, 1 hour later the "current" Activity 
will be automatically stopped ans a 2-hours-long Work item will be recorded.</p>
