<h1>Destroy Public Task dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Public Task dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Public Task.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Destroy Public Task dialog" height="223" src="../../../images/Dialogs/19-DestroyPublicTask.png" width="361" /></p>
<p>
When destroying a Public Task, any Work items and Events recorded for that 
Public Task and all its sub-tasks will be destroyed along with it. The Destroy Public 
Task dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Public Task's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Public Tasks capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Public Tasks. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see all Public Tasks defined there unless the User is configured to 
restrict the list of Public Tasks that User can work on.</p>
