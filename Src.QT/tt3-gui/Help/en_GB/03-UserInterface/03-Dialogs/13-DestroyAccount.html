<h1>Destroy Account dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Account dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Account.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Destroy Account dialog" height="203" src="../../../images/Dialogs/13-DestroyAccount.png" width="398" /></p>
<p>
When destroying an Account, any Work items and comments logged for that Account 
will also be destroyed. The Destroy Account dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Account's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Users capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Accounts. Specifically, a user cannot destroy their own Account 
otherwise.</p>
<p>
Since destroying Accounts (and affecting the recorded work history) is a very 
dangerous operation, it is strongly recommended that Accounts who e.g. leave the 
company are "disable" rather than destroyed.</p>
