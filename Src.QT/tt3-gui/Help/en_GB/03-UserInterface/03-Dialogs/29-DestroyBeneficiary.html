<h1>Destroy Beneficiary dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Beneficiary&nbsp;dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Beneficiary.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Destroy Beneficiary dialog" height="243" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/29-DestroyBeneficiary.png" width="471" /></p>
<p>
When destroying a Beneficiary, any 
Projects and Work Streams associated with the destroyed Beneficiary will lose their 
association with that Beneficiary. As a consequence, any Work items and comments logged for the 
Activities and Tasks 
allocated to these Projects and Work Streams will lose their attribution to a specific 
Beneficiary. The Destroy Beneficiary dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Beneficiary's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Beneficiaries capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Beneficiaries. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see all Beneficiaries defined there.</p>
