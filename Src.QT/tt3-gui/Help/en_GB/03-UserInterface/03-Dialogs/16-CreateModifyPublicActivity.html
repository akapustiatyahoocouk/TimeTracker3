<h1>Create/Modify Public Activity dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Public Activities and modifying existing 
Public Activities.</p>

<p>The fields in the Create/Modify Public Activity&nbsp; dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - Public Activities are identified by short, 
	descriptive names (such as "Dev testing", "Lunch break" and so on) which must 
	be unique within a given workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - if the Public Activity name is not 
	self-explanatory, its description may help to clarify its meaning. Multiple 
	lines of text may be entered here.</li>
	<li><strong>Activity type</strong> - use this drop-down list to select the 
	Activity Type to assign the Public Activity to.</li>
	<li><strong>Workload</strong> - use this drop-down list and its associated 
	selection button to assign a Public Activity to a specific Project or Work 
	Stream. Such assignments help in tracking effort dedicated to individual 
	Projects over a period of time.</li>
	<li><strong>Timeout</strong> - these fields govern what happens if the user 
	starts recording the Public Activity but then 
	leaves the computer unattended. If this is to happen, TimeTracker3 may 
	automatically finish the Public Activity in question, logging a comment to that 
	effect. NOTE that this behavior overrides any "inactivity timeout" 
	configured for the User as far as the Public Activity in question is 
	concerned.</li>
	<li><strong>Require comment when starting/stopping this activity</strong> - 
	these two check boxes specify what happens when the Public Activity is 
	started and stopped. If any of the two are checked, then TimeTracker3 will 
	present a popup dialog requesting the user to enter a comment, which is then 
	recorded into the workspace as an Event. If the Activity that is being 
	recorded requires comment when stopped, and the switch is made to recording 
	an Activity which requires a comment when started, the user is asked to 
	enter the comment only once; such comment is then associated with both old 
	and new recorded Activity.</li>
	<li><strong>Full-screen reminder</strong> - if checked, then starting such a 
	Public Activity will pop up a full-screen reminder window stating that the 
	Public Activity is underway (and how long it is being recorded for); this 
	popup window will be hidden when the recording of the Public Activity is 
	stopped. This is beneficial for Public Activities which expect the user to 
	leave their workplace (such as lunch breaks, meetings, etc.) - having a 
	full-screen reminder helps the user to explicitly stop recording the Public 
	Activity, logging an "away from keyboard" Work item and switching to the 
	next Activity to work on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only someone with Administrator or Manage Public Activities capabilities is 
allowed to create or modify Public Activities. However, anyone who can log into a 
given workspace can see all Public Activities defined there. The exception to 
this rule is the case when a specific User is configured to only allow working 
on specific Public Activities, in which case only these Public Activities will 
be visible in the list and all other existing Public Activities will not be 
visible.</p>
