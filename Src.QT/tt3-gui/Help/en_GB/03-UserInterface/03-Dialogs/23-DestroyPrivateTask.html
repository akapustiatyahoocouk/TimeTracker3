<h1>Destroy Private Task dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Private Task dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Private Task.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Destroy Private Task dialog" height="223" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/23-DestroyPrivateTask.png" width="357" /></p>
<p>
When destroying a Private Task, any Work items and Events recorded for that 
Private Task and all its sub-tasks will be destroyed along with it. The Destroy Private 
Task dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Private Activity's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Private Tasks capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Private Tasks. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see their own Private Tasks unless the User is configured to 
restrict the list of Private Tasks that User can work on.</p>
