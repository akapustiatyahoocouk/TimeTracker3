<h1>New Workspace dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The New Workspace dialog is invoked when the user, having logged in to 
TimeTracker3, wants to create a new workspace. As such, it will be invoked at 
least once before any useful work can be done.</p>
<p>
<img alt="New Workspace dialog" height="266" src="../../../images/Dialogs/02-NewWorkspace.png" width="597" /></p>
<p>The fields in the New Workspace dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Workspace type</strong> - TimeTracker3 allows using a variety of 
	technologies to store workspaces, the simplest one of which is storing the 
	entire workspace in a single XML file in the local file system (this is the 
	choice ideal for individual users who need to track their working time). 
	Other workspace types will be available depending on the installed 
	TimeTracker3 configuration and may range from local (or remote) databases to 
	a full-fledged remote storage.</li>
	<li><strong>Workspace location</strong> - a workspace is uniquely identified 
	by its "location", the exact nature of which varies with the workspace type. 
	For XML file workspaces this will be the full path to the XML file where the 
	workspace resides. Workspace locations are <em>not</em> directly editable; 
	instead, the <strong>Browse</strong> button will pop up the dialog where the 
	user can choose the location of the newly created workspace in a manner 
	appropriate for the chosen workspace type.</li>
	<li><strong>Administrator</strong> - every TimeTracker3 workspace is 
	required to have an "administrator" - a User who has an Account with the 
	Administrator capability. This field is for specifying the "real name" of 
	such user.</li>
	<li><strong>Login</strong> - the login identifier for the Account that will 
	be created with an Administrator privilege. This may or may not match the 
	Administrator User's "real name" - the choice is up to whoever created the 
	workspace.</li>
	<li><strong>Password</strong> - the administrator account created in the new 
	workspace can, and normally should, be password-protected. Since this is 
	prone to mis-typing errors, the <strong>Confirm</strong> password field must 
	be used to re-type the same password, thus preventing unwanted typos in 
	passwords.</li>
</ul>
<p>Upon creation of the new workspace TimeTracker3 immediately opens it. In 
order to smooth the workflow, the current login credentials (as previously 
specified via the Login dialog) are replaced with the login and password of the 
Administrator account created in the new workspace (as entered in the New 
Workspace dialog).</p>
<p>Note that a TimeTracker3 workspace may have more than one "administrator" 
defined there - the only requirement is that at any time there is at least one 
such. Additional accounts, including additional "administrator" accounts, may be 
created later in the Users view.</p>
