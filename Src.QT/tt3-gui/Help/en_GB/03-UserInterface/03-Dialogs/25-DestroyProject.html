<h1>Destroy Project dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Destroy Project&nbsp;dialog requests confirmation when an attempt is made to 
destroy an existing Project.</p>
<p>

<p>
When destroying a Project, all its sub-projects will be destroyed along with it; any 
Activities and Tasks associated with the destroyed Projects will lose that association 
with a Project. As a consequence, any Work items and comments logged for these 
Activities and Tasks 
will lose their attribution to a specific Project. The Destroy Project dialog will therefore show just how 
much an impact the Project's destruction will have on the recorded work history.</p>
<p>
Only someone with Administrator or Manage Workloads capabilities is allowed to 
destroy Projects. However, anyone who can log into a given workspace can 
see all Projects defined there.</p>
