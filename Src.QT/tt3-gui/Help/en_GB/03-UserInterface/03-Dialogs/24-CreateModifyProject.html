<h1>Create/Modify Project dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The same dialog is used for both creating new Projects and modifying existing 
Projects.</p>
<p>

<p>The fields in the Create/Modify Project dialog allow the user to specify:</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Parent project</strong> - Projects are organized into a 
	hierarchy where a Project can have sub-projects which, in turn, can have 
	further sub-projects, and so on. The parent for a Project is first chosen 
	when that Project is created but can be changed later.</li>
	<li><strong>Name</strong> - Projects are identified by short, 
	descriptive names (such as "Version 2 of the product", "Re-implementing the 
	legacy code base in e.g. Java" and so on) which must 
	be unique within a given workspace (if the Project has no parent) or 
	containing parent Project.</li>
	<li><strong>Description</strong> - if the Project name is not 
	self-explanatory, its description may help to clarify its meaning. Multiple 
	lines of text may be entered here.</li>
	<li><strong>Beneficiaries</strong> - a Project can be associated with one 
	(usually) or several Beneficiaries, who are the Project's stakeholders. This 
	field lists the Project's associated Beneficiaries and provides a Select 
	button to set up and modify that association as necessary.</li>
	<li><strong>Completed</strong> - use this check box to mark the Project 
	as "completed". It can also be used to "un-complete" a Project, but this 
	action requires an Administrator capability, as it breaks the normal 
	workflow of Projects.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only someone with Administrator or Manage Workloads capabilities is 
allowed to create or modify Projects. However, anyone who can log into a 
given workspace can see all Projects defined there.</p>
