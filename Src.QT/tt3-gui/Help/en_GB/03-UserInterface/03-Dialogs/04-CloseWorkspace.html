<h1>Close Workspace dialog</h1>
<hr />
<p>The Close Workspace dialog is invoked when the user wants to close the 
currently active workspace.</p>
<p>
<img alt="Close Workspace dialog" height="163" src="../../../images/en_GB/Dialogs/04-CloseWorkspace.png" width="388" /></p>
<p>The dialog offers no fields that the user can interact with - it's a simple 
yes or no question for increased workflow security - if any Activity is in the 
process of being recorded, its recording will stop (and the corresponding Work 
unit will be logged) before the workspace is closed.</p>
