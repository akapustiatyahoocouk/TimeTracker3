# TimeTracker3
A portable tool for tracking the working time dedicated to various activities

## Versioning and release cycle
- Versions are of the form MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD, all of which are decimal integers.
- MAJOR increments by 1 each time new concepts are introduced.
- MINOR increments by 1 each time new APIs (services) are introduced and restart from 0 when MAJOR increments.
- BUILD increments by 1 with each official build and never restart (i.e. are continuous).
- A separate STAGE (alpha, beta, RTM, GA) tags every MAJOR.MINOR.BUILD tuple.
